                    <p><strong>Eating well fuels your body for workouts and daily life.</strong> Focus
on balanced meals that include lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.
Stay hydrated throughout the day by drinking plenty of water and be mindful of
portion sizes. Eating too much or too little can affect your energy levels and
progress. Simple, consistent choices make a big difference over time.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rest is a key part of any fitness journey.</strong> Your muscles grow
and repair while you sleep, and proper recovery helps prevent burnout and
injuries. Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep each night and take rest days seriously.
Listening to your body helps you stay strong and consistent.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fitness is just as mental as it is physical.</strong> Managing
stress, staying positive, and setting realistic goals can help you stay motivated
even when progress feels slow. Take time for mindfulness, whether it’s stretching,
meditating, or journaling to stay focused and build a healthy mindset.</p>
